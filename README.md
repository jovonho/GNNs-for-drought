# GNNs for Drought - 599 Project

## Setup
- Create a virtual environment and activate it
    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv/Scripts/activate
    ```
- Install requirements
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (By the way, if you add code run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to update the requirements file)

- Run code (will attempt to download data from CDS). You'll need to setup an API key for it to work on your system. See instructions here https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
- That's it for now ;) Let's do this team!!
